Freeing a great many small objects could take time quadratic in the number of arenas, due to using linear search to keep ``obmalloc.c``'s list of usable arenas sorted by order of number of free memory pools.  This is accomplished without search now, leaving the worst-case time linear in the number of arenas.  For programs where this quite visibly matters (typically with more than 100 thousand small objects alive simultaneously), this can greatly reduce the time needed to release their memory.
