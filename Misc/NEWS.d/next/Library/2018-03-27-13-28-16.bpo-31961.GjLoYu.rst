Added support for bytes and path-like objects in :func:`subprocess.Popen`
on Windows.  The *args* parameter now accepts a :term:`path-like object` if
*shell* is ``False`` and a sequence containing bytes and path-like objects.
The *executable* parameter now accepts a bytes and :term:`path-like object`.
The *cwd* parameter now accepts a bytes object.
Based on patch by Anders Lorentsen.
